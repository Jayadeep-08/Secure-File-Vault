🔐 Cipher Tool in C + Web Interface (Local)

This project provides both a **command-line** and a **web-based interface (local)** for encrypting and decrypting text using:

- **Caesar Cipher**
- **Columnar Transposition Cipher**

Each encryption/decryption process generates a **unique identifier (UID)** to help track and verify messages.

## 🌐 Web Version (Local Use Only)

The web version runs on a **local Python server**. Here's how to launch it:

### 🛠️ Steps to Run

1. **Open Command Prompt**  
   Navigate to the directory where the project files are saved.

2. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   python app.py

3. **Copy the local link shown in the terminal** (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000 or similar).

4. **Paste the link in your browser**.

## The web-based cipher interface will open and be ready to use!
